## 💤 Unused or Redundant Files

- No clear unused files detected in frontend `src` (all files are empty, so usage can't be determined yet).

## 🔁 Duplicate or Outdated Components

- No duplicate components detected (all files are empty or stubs).

## 🧩 Potential Refactor Targets

- No route handlers or models to refactor yet (all backend files are empty).

---

## Next Actions

- **Implement or remove empty backend files**: If not needed, delete. If needed, add minimal boilerplate or documentation.
- **Initialize backend `package.json` and `package-lock.json`**: These should not be empty.
- **Populate `.env` with required environment variables**: Or remove if not needed.
- **Begin implementing backend logic**: Start with `index.js`, `snippets.js`, `snippetModel.js`, and `snippetsController.js` as per your architecture.
- **No frontend cleanup needed yet**: All files are stubs/placeholders.
