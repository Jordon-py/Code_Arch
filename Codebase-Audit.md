# 🧠 Codebase Audit Report

## Component & File Usage Analysis

### 🗃️ Empty or Near-Empty Files

### `/frontend/src/components/SnippetCard/SnippetCard.jsx` (Unused Module)

**Flag:** 🗃️ Empty file

**Root Issue:** No implementation or export present

**Mentor Insight:** This file is likely a placeholder for a component that was never implemented or was removed. Keeping empty files can cause confusion and bloat in the codebase.

**Refactor Tip:** Remove the file if not needed, or implement the component if planned.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Avoid leaving empty files in the repository; they should be either implemented or deleted.

**Suggestion:** If a SnippetCard component is needed, scaffold it with prop types and a minimal render.

---

### `/frontend/src/data/snippets.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Empty file

**Root Issue:** No data or export present

**Mentor Insight:** This file may have been intended for static snippet data or as a mock data source. Empty data files can mislead future contributors.

**Refactor Tip:** Remove or populate with sample data if used for development/testing.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Keep data files meaningful and up-to-date.

---

### `/frontend/src/components/SnippetList.jsx`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial implementation (only a stub comment and export)

**Root Issue:** No logic or rendering present

**Mentor Insight:** This file is a stub and does not provide any functionality. It may be a placeholder for future development.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement the component or remove the file until needed.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Avoid committing stubs unless part of an active development branch.

---

### `/frontend/src/hooks/useSnippets.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only a stub function present

**Mentor Insight:** Custom hooks should encapsulate reusable logic. This file currently does not provide any value.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement the hook or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Only include hooks that are used and provide meaningful abstraction.

---

### `/frontend/src/services/snippetApi.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only comments, no implementation

**Mentor Insight:** Service files should encapsulate API logic. This file is a placeholder.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement API methods or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Service files should be implemented or omitted.

---

### `/frontend/src/utils/normalizeTags.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only a comment, no logic

**Mentor Insight:** Utility files should provide reusable logic. This file is a placeholder.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement the utility or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Only include utility files with actual logic.

---

### `/server/controllers/snippetsController.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only comments, no implementation

**Mentor Insight:** Controller files should contain business logic for routes. This file is a placeholder.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement controller logic or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Controller files should be implemented or omitted.

---

### `/server/models/Snippet.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only comments, no schema defined

**Mentor Insight:** Model files should define Mongoose schemas. This file is a placeholder.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement the schema or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Model files should be implemented or omitted.

---

### `/server/routes/snippets.js`

**Flag:** 🗃️ Trivial/boilerplate

**Root Issue:** Only comments, no route definitions

**Mentor Insight:** Route files should define Express routes. This file is a placeholder.

**Refactor Tip:** Implement the routes or remove the file.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Route files should be implemented or omitted.

---

## 💤 Unused or Stale Modules

### `/frontend/src/components/SnippetCard/SnippetCard.jsx`

// 🔍 Not referenced in any import map — likely stale module

**Root Issue:** No imports found across frontend

**Mentor Insight:** This likely indicates dead component logic or unfinished feature.

**Refactor Tip:** Consider merging or safely removing after verifying against dynamic imports.

**Best Practice Reminder:** Keep components traceable from your UI map.

---

## 🔁 Redundant or Duplicated Logic

_No direct duplication detected in provided files, but monitor for repeated patterns as the codebase grows._

---

## 🧩 Refactor Candidates

- Consider abstracting repeated form validation logic (if it appears in multiple places) into a shared utility.
- If multiple components use similar layout or animation logic, abstract into hooks or HOCs.
