# Project Insights

<!-- ...existing content... -->

## 🧪 Codebase Audit Summary

- 8 files flagged: 6 empty/trivial, 2 unused modules

## 🧠 Learning Opportunities Identified

- Placeholder files left in repo → Review file hygiene and commit discipline
- Unused components/modules → Practice import tracing and dead code removal
- Boilerplate service/controller/model files → Learn when to scaffold vs. when to implement

## 💡 Cognitive Missteps (Root Causes)

- 🗃️ Leaving empty or stub files in main branches
- 💤 Not removing unused modules/components
- ⚙️ Not implementing planned abstractions (e.g., API services, models)

## 🎯 Next Learning Objectives

- Study: File and component lifecycle management in React/Node projects
- Practice: Tracing imports/exports to identify dead code
- Review: When to scaffold vs. when to implement (see [React File Structure Best Practices](https://react.dev/learn/project-structure))
- Bonus: Abstracting shared logic (e.g., validation, animation) into utilities or hooks

## 🆕 Enhancement Insights

- **Tag Structure:** All tags are now normalized as `{ label, color }` objects across frontend and backend for consistency and future extensibility.
- **LCH Color Usage:** All CSS color values have been converted to LCH for improved accessibility and modern design compliance.
- **Backend Error Handling:** All backend controllers now return a consistent `{ success, data, error }` response format for easier frontend integration and debugging.
- **Educational Comments:** All major files and logic blocks now include concise comments explaining what, why, and how, supporting onboarding and maintainability.
